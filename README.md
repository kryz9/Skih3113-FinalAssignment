Objective: Design and implement an intelligent environmental monitoring system using an ESP32 or Raspberry Pi microcontroller. The system should collect, process, store, and analyze data from various sensors and utilize the insights to drive an output application.

Requirements:
1.	Microcontroller: Use either an ESP or Raspberry Pi.
2.	Sensors: Include at least three different types of environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality, light, soil moisture).
3.	Data Collection: Gather data from the sensors at regular intervals.
4.	Data Processing: Process the collected data to extract meaningful insights (e.g., average, min/max, trends).
5.	Data Storage: Store the processed data locally or on a cloud service.
6.	Data Analysis: Implement basic analysis to derive insights from the stored data.
7.	Output Application: Use the insights to control an output application (e.g., turning on a fan, adjusting irrigation, sending notifications).
8.	User Interface: Provide a basic user interface (web-based/mobile app/ desktop app) to visualize the data and insights.
